    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **`GET`** - Get results from a SQL request\n",
    "* **`POST`** - Request an Access token, or issue an SQL command\n",
    "\n",
    "All RESTful calls require the host IP address and the service URL:\n",
    "* **`host`** - This is the IP address of the machine that is hosting Db2 on Cloud\n",
    "* **`api`** - The API library that is being used to communicate with Db2 on Cloud\n",
    "* **`service`** - The service (API) that is being requested. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the API library that is used for Db2 on Cloud is `/dbapi/v3`. The full URL has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https:// + host + api + service\n",
    "```\n",

The second form of the RESTful call will supply parameters through the **`json=data`** keyword, and also supply the access token via the **`headers=tokens`** keyword. Any SQL request needs this access token to be supplied, otherwise the Db2 on Cloud service will not be able to authenticate the RESTful call."

    "To make the process of getting an answer back easier, the following code will take all of the previous steps and encapsulate them into a single call. The function has the following format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "restSQL(db2id,sql)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function will return a pandas dataframe as a result set. The parameters are:\n",
    "* db2id - The id information from the Db2 Cloud service which includes the access_token created earlier\n",
    "* sql - The SQL to be executed (single statement only)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the issues when using access tokens is that they expire after a certain period of time. This makes the access more secure since a token will expire in the event that it was accidentially released externally. However, this means that your queries may not work after a period of time because of an expired access token. If you do get an error with the SQL call, you will need to request a new access token with the following call:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "db2id['access_token'] = get_token(db2id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code in this function also checks to make sure that the SQL has completed execution. There is a possibility that the SQL will run for a long period of time so the function needs to continuously poll the server with RESTful calls until the SQL has completed."

    "Using RESTful calls to Db2 removes much of the complexity of communicating with the database. There are no drivers required, no configuration file, nor any administration required on the client that is communicating with the database. All communication is done using RESTful API calls, which are available on all browsers and all operating systems. The calls to the database are replaced with standard POST and GET requests. Enabling RESTful support to Db2 opens up the type of applications that you can write and clients that you can connect to Db2 with."
